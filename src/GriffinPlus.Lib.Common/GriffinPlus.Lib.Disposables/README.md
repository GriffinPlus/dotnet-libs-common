This folder contains helper classes assisting with writing classes that need specific disposable semantics.

These classes were originally written by Stephen Cleary, who put them under the MIT license.
See the [project page](https://github.com/StephenCleary/Disposables) for details.

The original classes were modified slightly to fit into the Griffin+ codebase.

# IDisposable helper types.

## AnonymousDisposable

The `AnonymousDisposable` type wraps an `Action`, and invokes that `Action` exactly once when it is disposed. The first
thread to call `Dispose` is the one that invokes the `Action`; all other threads that call `Dispose` are blocked until
the `Action` is completed. Once the `Action` is completed, it is never invoked again; future calls to `AnonymousDisposable.Dispose`
are no-ops.

You can create an `AnonymousDisposable` by calling `AnonymousDisposable.Create(Action)` or `new AnonymousDisposable(Action)`.

### Advanced

You can append an `Action` to an `AnonymousDisposable` by calling its `Add` method with the `Action` to add. If the
`AnonymousDisposable` is already disposed (or is in the process of being disposed by another thread), then the additional
`Action` is invoked immediately.

## CollectionDisposable

`CollectionDisposable` contains a collection of `IDisposable` instances, and disposes them all exactly once when it is
disposed. The first thread to call `Dispose` is the one that disposes all instances; all other threads that call
`Dispose` are blocked until all instances have been disposed. Once disposed, future calls to `CollectionDisposable.Dispose`
are no-ops.

You can create a `CollectionDisposable` by calling `CollectionDisposable.Create(...)` or `new CollectionDisposable(...)`,
passing the collection of disposables.

You can also append a disposable to the `CollectionDisposable` by calling its `Add` method and passing it the disposable.
If the `CollectionDisposable` is already disposed (or is in the process of being disposed by another thread), then the
additional disposable is disposed immediately.

## NoopDisposable

An `IDisposable` that does nothing when disposed.

You can retrieve the singleton instance via `NoopDisposable.Instance`.

# Advanced Types

## SingleDisposable&lt;T&gt;

The `SingleDisposable<T>` type is a base type for disposables that desire exactly-once semantics, blocking other threads
calling `Dispose` until the initial `Dispose` is complete. Both `AnonymousDisposable` and `CollectionDisposable` inherit
from this type.

The type `T` is an immutable type that represents the contextual state of the instance. It is initialized in the
constructor, optionally updated by calling `TryUpdateContext`, and finally retrieved and passed to `Dispose(T)` exactly
once when `Dispose()` is called.

When the base type invokes `Dispose(T)`, your derived type should perform whatever disposing logic it needs to.

## SingleNonblockingDisposable&lt;T&gt;

The `SingleNonblockingDisposable<T>` type is a base type for disposables that desire exactly-once semantics *without*
blocking other threads calling `Dispose`. It works exactly like `SingleDisposable<T>`, except that once disposal has
started, other threads calling `Dispose` will return immediately, treating the additional `Dispose` calls as a no-op.
